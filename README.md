# genetic-sequence

Python implementation of the game [Sequence](http://www.jaxgames.com/seq2.htm) that uses genetic algorithms for CPU players.

To play:

```
python sequence.py
```

This game uses my own python implementation of genetic algorithms, which can be found [here](https://github.com/aleknaui/py-genetic).
